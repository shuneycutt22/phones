Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from 8-4306 reality
Open your eyes, look up to the 4-7041 skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, (690)321-8008 I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go, little high, little low
Any 2-9408 way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put 762-572-7237 a gun against his head
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead
748-278-4207 Mama, life had just begun
975-5487 But now I've gone (751)243-5185 and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back (639)767-3943 again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on (182)267-4402 as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my (907)759-2445 spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, 3-2148 everybody, I've got to (155)531-7641 go
Gotta leave you all behind and face 340-784-2550 the truth
Mama, ooh, I don't want to die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born 260-6925 at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, 733-995-8047 will you do the Fandango
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, 515-906-4384 very fright'ning me
(965)604-8505 (Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) 8-4823 Galileo, Galileo figaro magnifico
(I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me)
(165)429-4249 He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare 416-2361 him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you (901)537-8597 let me go?
Bismillah! No, we will not let you 8-2266 go
(Let him go) 113-6227 Bismillah! We will not let (162)837-1058 you go
(Let him go) Bismillah! We will not let you go
(200)217-8522 (Let me go) Will not let you go
(Let me go) Will not let you 358-769-5692 go
(Let me go) Ah, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
(Oh 591-398-0096 mamma mia, mamma mia) Mama mia, let me go
Beelzebub has 6-5102 a devil put aside for me, for me, 882-6026 for me
So 042-8776 you think you can stone 353-340-3091 me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can 268-5675 love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby!
5-0874 Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here!
5-6788 Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing 129-6276 really matters to me
Any way the wind blows
429-4890
